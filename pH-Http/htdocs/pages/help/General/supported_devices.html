<h2>Supported Devices</h2>
<div class='helpPage'>
	<p>Sky Router Tool currently supports the Netgear DG834GT and DG934G routers. Other routers may work if they are similar enough. If you would like support for your (preferably linux-based) router then send me an email and I'll see what I can do.</p>
